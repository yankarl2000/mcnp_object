# mcnp_object
trying to get an object-oriented mcnp model

include check_lost.py, that creates the script for SpaceClaim to build the lost particles

include change_hist.py, that creates many calculation folders to check for corrections of lost particles (not worked)

mcnp_parser.py will have to combine the functions of reading and writing .i files (some worked, some not)
With the ability to change the position of surfaces
With the ability to remove identical surfaces
